## Known Issues

[Please look here first, to decide if it is a Typegoose or an Mongoose issue.](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=is%3Aissue+involves%3Ahasezoey)

### transpile-only

Never run `ts-node --transpile-only` or `tsc --transpile-only`, otherwise sometimes types are missing completly or are the wrong type.

### tsconfig-paths

TypeScript provides the option to alias paths (with `tsconfig-paths`), but is somehow incompatible with Typegoose, [more info in here]([szokodiakos#392](https://github.com/szokodiakos/typegoose/issues/392))

### Self-Containing classes

It is currently not possible to use a self-containing class (sub-documents)

```ts
class SomeClass {
  @prop()
  public ref: SomeClass; // ERROR "Maximum Class Stack Size Exceeded"
}
```

For References, this will work

```ts
class SomeClass {
  @prop({ ref: () => SomeClass }) // or hardcode the string
  public ref: Ref<SomeClass>;
}
```

### Class-transformer

Typegoose (/Mongoose) currently doesn't work well with `class-transformer`. When you want to get a POJO, use `model.operation.lean()` OR `doc.toJSON()` - but `classToPlain` (or any other method from CT) will not work and map incorrect properties (More info: [typegoose#61](https://github.com/typegoose/typegoose/issues/61), [typegoose#9 (comment)]([typegoose#96](https://github.com/typegoose/typegoose/issues/96)#issuecomment-549031131), [class-transformer#227](https://github.com/typestack/class-transformer/issues/227))

### Babel

Using babel as a TypeScript compiler is known to cause problems (like incorrect types)  
We recommened you use `tsc` directly, or `ts-node` or `ts-jest` for jest-testing

If Babel is still needed, then read [Babel TypeScript preset](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-typescript) and install the following plugins:
you will need to reproduce the `--experimentalDecorators` and `--emitDecoratorMetadata` [TypeScript compiler options](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-typescript#typescript-compiler-options) by using the corresponding plugins for [enabling decorators](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-decorators) and [emitting decorator metadata](https://github.com/leonardfactory/babel-plugin-transform-typescript-metadata):

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    ['@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators', { legacy: true }],
    'babel-plugin-transform-typescript-metadata',
  ]
}
```

### prop on get & set

`@prop` cannot be applied to `get` & `set` (ES6), because virtuals do not accept options & schema.loadClass wouldn't load these.

## Known Mongoose incompatibilities

### typePojoToMixed

This option will **NOT** work, because there is no neat / simple way of defining such a thing in the same class.

Workaround:  
Create multiple classes:

```ts
class Sub {
  @prop()
  public name: string;
}

class Parent {
  @prop()
  public subDoc: Sub;
}
```

### @types/mongoose@5.7.22 and higher

Since `@types/mongoose@5.7.22`, there are types for `.create`, but they are not fully compatible with Typegoose's types. So if an error comes up that cannot be fixed, the workaround is to use `<any>`

```ts
model.create<any>({ anything: anything });
```
